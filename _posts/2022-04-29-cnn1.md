# Convolutional Neural Networks - Part 1

This project analyses the different architecture, specificities, and historical advancements of 3 pre-trained Convolution Neural Network (CNN) models:
* Inception-ResNet v2
* MobileNetV3
* NASNet

By using transfer learning with these models, this project also aims to analyse and compare their performance and limitations when predicting 101 classes of food from the Food101 dataset.

### Introduction to Computer Vision and Convolutional Neural Networks
Convolutional neural networks have demonstrated excellent results in computer vision tasks like in image classification. Inspired by the optical and neural systems in humans, CNNâ€™s involve a special type of multi-layer neural network.
