# Data Visualisation in R - Part 1

R is a very popular programming language for data science. One of the great things about R is the amount of packages available to use. In this post, I will be utilising several packages from the tidyverse package: dplyr and tidyr (which are great for preparing and wrangling data), and ggplot2 (which is popular for visualisations). RStudio is the integrated development environment (IDE) for R.

#### Data Selection and Cleaning
The dataset that I’m analysing is about women’s international football results. I chose this dataset because, as a player and a fan of the game, I found it interesting and wanted to see what new insights I could gain. The dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/womens-international-football-results), it has 4,163 rows and 9 columns, covering results of games from all major tournaments from 1969-2020.  

I loaded the dataset into RStudio, as well as the packages I will use. I then used some exploratory functions to get an overview of the data, as well as checking for correct formatting and missing values.

```r
#### LOAD LIBRARIES ####
library(tidyverse)
library(DataExplorer)
library(png)
library(grid)

#### LOAD DATA ####
data <- read_csv("wc_results.csv")

# functions to get an overview of the data
str(data)
introduce(data)
summary(data)
plot_intro(data)
```

I added additional variables:

```r
# get year from date column (as a numeric value)
data$year <- format(data$date, format = "%Y")
data$year <- as.numeric(data$year)

# make binary columns for game results
data$home_win <- ifelse(data$home_score > data$away_score, 1, 0)
data$away_win <- ifelse(data$home_score < data$away_score, 1, 0)
data$draw <- ifelse(data$home_score == data$away_score, 1, 0)
```

Then summarised the data to get counts for each country:

```r
# use summarise() function to get average goals per game and number of games, goals, ... 
# ... wins, draws, and losses. (for both home and away games)
home_data <- data %>% 
  # group by home team to get information on each team
  group_by(home_team) %>% 
  summarise(
    # get number of home games per team
    n_home_games = n(),
    # get number of 'goals for' per team for home games
    home_gf = sum(home_score),
    # get number of 'goals against' per team for home games
    home_ga = sum(away_score),
    # get average goals scored per home game for each team
    avg_goals_homegame = home_gf/n_home_games,
    # get number of wins per team for home games
    n_home_win = sum(home_win),
    # get number of draws per team for home games
    n_home_draw = sum(draw),
    # get number of losses per team for home games
    n_home_lose = n_home_games - n_home_win - n_home_draw)
away_data <- data %>% 
  # group by away team to get information for each team
  group_by(away_team) %>% 
  summarise(
    # get number of away games per team
    n_away_games = n(),
    # get number of 'goals for' per team for away games
    away_gf = sum(away_score),
    # get number of 'goals against' per team for away games
    away_ga = sum(home_score),
    # get average goals scored per away game for each team
    avg_goals_awaygame = away_gf/n_away_games,
    # get number of wins per team for away games
    n_away_win = sum(away_win),
    # get number of draws per team for away games
    n_away_draw = sum(draw),
    # get number of losses per team for away games
    n_away_lose = n_away_games - n_away_win - n_away_draw)

# merge home & away data, calculate totals, and select the variables of interest
new_data <- merge(
  # specify which data frames to merge
  home_data, away_data,
  # specify which columns to merge by
  by.x="home_team", by.y = "away_team", 
  # to keep all rows (even if the team isn't in both data frames)
  all.x = TRUE, all.y = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(
    team = home_team,
    # get total number of games
    n_games = n_home_games + n_away_games,
    # get total goals for
    gf = home_gf + away_gf,
    # get total goals against
    ga = home_ga + away_ga,
    # get average goals scored per game
    avg_goals_game = gf/n_games,
    # get total number of wins
    n_win = n_home_win + n_away_win,
    # get total number of draws
    n_draw = n_home_draw + n_away_draw,
    # get total number of losses
    n_lose = n_home_lose + n_away_lose) %>% 
  # select the variables of interest
  select(team, n_games, n_home_games, n_away_games, gf, ga, avg_goals_game, n_win, n_draw, n_lose)
```

Then calculated the proportions of wins, draws, and losses for each team (which I will use for my second visualisation):

```r
# mutate and select variables, and transform from variable to observation
results_proportion <- new_data %>% 
  mutate(country = team, 
         # calculate proportion of games won by team (to 2 s.f)
         win_proportion = signif(n_win/n_games, 3),
         # calculate proportion of games lost by team (to 2 s.f)
         lose_proportion = signif(n_lose/n_games, 3),
         # calculate proportion of games drawn by team (to 2 s.f)
         draw_proportion = signif(n_draw/n_games, 3)) %>%
  # select the variables of interest
  select(country, win_proportion, lose_proportion, draw_proportion) %>% 
  # gather columns into key-value pairs
  gather(Proportion, Value, win_proportion:draw_proportion, -country)
```

g4 <- rasterGrob(img4, interpolate=TRUE)

# create an object with the years in which the FIFA world cup was held
world_cup_year <- c(1991, 1995, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011, 2015, 2019)

plot01 <- data %>%

  labs(title = "Number of Matches Each Year", 
       subtitle = "Years with FIFA World Cup highlighted, with flags indicating the winners", 
       x = "Year") +
  # change feature of the plot (to make the background transparent and other adjustments)
  theme(legend.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent"),
        legend.box.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent"),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", color = NA),
        legend.position = "none", 
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_text(colour = "black", face = "bold"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(colour = "black", face = "bold")) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,2))
# view plot

# save plot
ggsave(plot01, filename = "plot01.png")
```

To learn more about how women's international football has changed over time, I created a bar chart (Figure 7) showing the number of games that were played each year. As I wanted to investigate the women’s FIFA world cup, I used bright red to highlight the years in which that tournament took place. I used the annotation_custom() function from ggplot2 to insert the flag images on to the plot representing the winning country of that year’s world cup. And I was able to customise the appearance of the plot using the theme() function.
