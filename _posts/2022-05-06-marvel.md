# Data Visualisation in R

The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is the highest grossing film franchise of all time. Having earned over $21 billion (USD) in worldwide box office sales between 2008 when the first Iron Man movie was released, and 2019 when Avengers: Endgame came out. The MCU also has the longest run-time of any film franchise, with over 48 hours of screen time spanning 22 films.

With this analysis, I aim to gain an understanding of which characters have been the most influential in driving the success of this franchise.

The data used in this analysis was compiled from IMDB. The dataset contains the movie title, character name, screen time in minutes (rounded to the nearest minute), phase (1-3), and movie release order.

The target audience for this data story is movie and comic book enthusiasts. 

 


I analysed the number of appearances and screen time for 10 characters. Figure 1 shows which of these characters appeared in each film.

Tied for the most appearances are Iron Man and Captain America, both having appeared in 10 out of 22 films.

Interestingly, with 9 appearances, the character with the next highest number of appearances is Black Widow, despite her not having a single stand-alone movie in this series. Black Widow appears most often alongside captain America, with all but 2 of her appearances also featuring the captain. The popularity of her character in this series, no doubt, was a big influence on her later getting her own movie.

In all 4 of the movies that Spiderman appears in, Ironman is also in. This is to be expected, as Spidermanâ€™s first appearance in Captain America: Civil War involved Iron Man brining Spiderman to join the avengers team.

The character that shares the least movies with the other 9 characters in this analysis is StarLord, from the Guardians of the Galaxy movies. Of the 4 movies that he is in, half of them do not feature any of the 9 other characters. This is not surprising, as the Guardians of the Galaxy movies mostly take place in space or on other planets, whereas the other movies in this series mostly take place on earth.

 

To split the tie for first place between Iron Man and Captain America, I analysed the amount of screen time that the characters had.

As you can see in Figure 2, Iron Man had by far the most screen time, with 357 minutes (5 hours and 57 minutes). Whereas Captain America had 245 minutes (4 hours and 5 minutes).




With the stories for many of the popular characters coming to a close at the end of this phase of films, this opens the door for other characters to step up and take their place in the next phase of MCU films and TV shows. It will be interesting to see if Marvel can build on the success of these films as they introduce new characters.
