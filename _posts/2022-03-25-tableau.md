# Data Visualisation on Tableau

For this post, I have chosen to use Tableau Desktop as the visualisation tool. I hadn't used Tableau before this, but I had heard positive things about it, and so I was excited to try it out.

Tableau is one of the fastest growing data visualisation tools in the business intelligence industry. One of its advantages is that it does not require users to have programming knowledge. Its user-friendly design and drag-and-drop operation allows users to create high-quality visualisations with ease.

#### Data Selection and Cleaning:

I chose the FIFA22 player dataset because it had both quantitative (discrete and continuous) and qualitative data (including geographical), which allowed me to try out many different types of visualisations. Also, as a soccer fan and player, I found this data very interesting.

I downloaded this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-22-complete-player-dataset?select=players_22.csv) from Kaggle (data was originally scraped from [sofifa.com](https://sofifa.com/)), it has 19,239 rows and 110 columns. The dataset contains player information (e.g., name, age, nationality), player skills (e.g., pace, shooting, passing), and club data (e.g., club name, league name, league level).

I found that Tableau Desktop didn't offer many advanced data cleaning options, but luckily this dataset didn't require extensive cleaning. On the Data Source page, I changed the geographic role on the nationality_name variable from "None" to "Country/Region" (Figure 2), and removed variables that wouldn't be used with the hide option (Figure 3).

#### Analysis:

To create a histogram of players age, I created a binned dimension for Age (Figure 4 & Figure 5), which I put on the column shelf, and I put count of Age on the row shelf. The drag-and-drop ability in Tableau made this a simple process.

Figure 6 shows the age distribution for players. Player's age ranges from 16 to 54 years old, however the one 54-year-old player is considered an outlier in this dataset (and is hardly visible in the plot, which is why I added the label). The age that appears most frequently in this dataset is 21 (1,547 players), there is a considerable decrease in players each year starting at 30 years old, and the majority of players (~75%) are between 19 and 29 years old.

The map visualisation option in Tableau is very useful, as maps can be a great way to communicate results. Figure 7 shows the nationalities of players in this dataset.

Creating the map was easy (just click the map option in the "Show me" menu); however, some of the countries in the nationality_name variable didn't have a matching location in Tableau (Figure 8), and so they didn't show up on the map initially. This was fixed for some countries by manually matching the location (“map” > “edit locations”), but for others countries it was more difficult. This dataset has players from England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; however, in Tableau, these countries are recognised as states/provinces of the UK, and therefore aren’t shown in “country/region”. So, these countries all had to be manually changed to the UK in order to show on the map.

#### Challenges:

Data cleaning – the data cleaning functions in tableau are basic compared to tools like R and python. If the dataset isn’t already clean, it could be difficult to make accurate visualisations. 
Cost – considering there are free/open-sourced tools that can create great visualisations, some organisations may not be able to justify the cost of Tableau.

#### Opportunities:

Accessibility – it doesn’t require programming knowledge, meaning it can be used by anyone.
Tableau Prep – Tableau has a separate [data preperation tool](https://www.tableau.com/products/prep) that can be used (prior to visualising in Tableau Desktop) to clean and shape data.

#### Conclusion:

Tableau is great for data exploration, and it makes visualisation a breeze. It will support most of the things needed for exploration and visualisation, but it doesn’t allow for the same flexibility that you can get with other tools.
